/// Wires Android's incoming `ACTION_VIEW`/`ACTION_SEND` intents (BRD §7.7,
/// TASK-009) to [IncomingDocumentResolver] and, on success, the same
/// [DocumentInteractionController.openDocument] seam every other entry point
/// uses (Home, Files, Search, Recents, Favorites).
///
/// Deliberately thin: the actual decision logic lives in [IncomingDocumentResolver],
/// which is unit-tested directly (`test/services/incoming_document_resolver_test.dart`).
/// [handle] and [init] are not covered by any `testWidgets` test in this
/// codebase: a minimal repro (isolated across eleven progressively smaller
/// cases, not assumed from one failure) showed that in this Flutter 3.44.4
/// environment, a `testWidgets` test that both (a) imports anything reaching
/// `document_repository_impl.dart` (i.e. `sqflite`) - which every path to
/// [IncomingDocumentResolver] does - and (b) calls
/// `Directory.systemTemp.createTemp()` anywhere in the same file, hangs
/// `flutter_test`'s own teardown, regardless of whether either import is
/// actually exercised at runtime. Real intent *delivery* from Android is
/// separately unverifiable here anyway (no emulator) - see TASK-009's
/// implementation delta for the full writeup; this is a documented
/// environment gap, not a defect in this class.
