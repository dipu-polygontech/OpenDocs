# OpenDocs — Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Product Name:** OpenDocs  
**Product Type:** Fully Offline Mobile Document Reader  
**Primary Platform:** Android  
**Planned Framework:** Flutter  
**Product Scope:** Reader-only  
**Supported Core Formats:** PDF, DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, TXT, CSV  
**Connectivity Model:** Fully offline; no server dependency for document reading  

---

# 1. Executive Summary

OpenDocs is a privacy-first, fully offline mobile application that allows users to discover, open, read, search, and navigate common document formats stored locally on their device.

The application is intentionally focused on **reading only**. It will not edit documents, upload documents to cloud services, require user accounts, or depend on a backend for rendering.

The core user promise is:

> **OpenDocs lets users read their documents privately, locally, and offline.**

The product should feel fast, simple, reliable, and consistent across file formats while preserving each format's natural viewing model:

- PDF → page-based reader
- DOC/DOCX → paginated or flow-based document reader
- XLS/XLSX/CSV → spreadsheet grid viewer
- PPT/PPTX → slide viewer
- TXT → lightweight text reader

---

# 2. Business Goals

## 2.1 Primary Goals

1. Provide one application for reading major document formats.
2. Operate fully offline after installation.
3. Keep user documents on-device.
4. Make document discovery fast and intuitive.
5. Preserve reading progress across sessions.

7. Provide reliable handling for corrupted, unsupported, locked, moved, or deleted files.
8. Avoid unnecessary complexity associated with editing, cloud sync, collaboration, or accounts.

## 2.2 Secondary Goals

1. Build a modular architecture that allows new document formats later.
2. Keep the product suitable for low-end and mid-range Android devices.
3. Allow the app to be registered as an OS-level document opener.
4. Create a privacy-focused positioning that differentiates OpenDocs from cloud-centric readers.

# 6. Product Principles

## 6.1 Fully Offline

All document discovery, metadata extraction, rendering, navigation, search, caching, recent history, favorites, and reading progress must work without internet access.

## 6.2 Reader Only

Users can open and read files, but OpenDocs must not modify original document contents.

## 6.3 Non-Destructive

Operations performed by OpenDocs should never alter the original document unless a future explicitly scoped feature requires it.

## 6.4 Privacy First

Document contents, filenames, paths, reading history, and search terms should remain on-device.

## 6.5 Format-Appropriate UX

Each file type should use a viewer suited to its document model instead of forcing every format into a generic viewer.

---

# 19. Acceptance Criteria by Module

## File Discovery

- Supported files appear correctly.
- Unsupported files do not pollute normal lists.
- Re-scan does not duplicate entries.

## Recents

- Successful open updates Recents.
- Clearing Recents never deletes files.

## Favorites

- Favorite state persists across app restart.

## PDF

- Can open, navigate, zoom, search, and restore page.

## Word

- Common text/images/tables are readable.

## Excel

- Workbook sheets and cell values are readable.

## PowerPoint

- Slides render and can be navigated.

## Offline

- All core flows pass in airplane mode.

---

# 20. Security Requirements

- Validate file size before parsing.
- Add maximum decompression safeguards for Office container formats.
- Handle malformed documents without app termination.
- Avoid executing macros.
- Avoid executing embedded scripts.
- Treat hyperlinks as external navigation requiring explicit user action.
- Do not auto-launch embedded executables.
- Sanitize extracted temporary filenames.
- Restrict temporary files to app sandbox.
- Clear temporary rendering files according to cache policy.

---

# 21. Accessibility Requirements

- Support system text scaling where applicable.
- Buttons should have semantic labels.
- Touch targets should meet mobile accessibility guidance.
- Reader controls should support TalkBack where technically feasible.
- Contrast must remain readable in light/dark modes.
- Do not rely on color alone to communicate state.

---

# 22. Analytics Policy

Because OpenDocs is positioned as fully offline and privacy-first, v1.0 should preferably ship without network analytics.

If local-only usage counters are ever needed, they should remain on-device.

Document-sensitive information must never be collected for analytics, including:

- Filename
- File path
- Document content
- Search terms
- Reading position tied to identifiable file metadata

---

# 25. Definition of Done

OpenDocs v1.0 is considered functionally complete when a user can:

1. Install and launch the application.
2. Grant local document access.
3. Discover supported files.
4. Search and filter documents.
5. Open PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and TXT files.
6. Read documents fully offline.
7. Search inside supported documents.
8. Mark files as favorites.
9. View recent files.
10. Close and reopen the app.
11. Resume the previous reading location.
12. Handle unsupported, corrupted, missing, locked, or inaccessible files without crashing.

---

# 26. Product Positioning

**OpenDocs**  
**PDF, Word, Excel & PowerPoint Reader**

Suggested short description:

> A fast, private, fully offline reader for PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and text files.

Suggested privacy statement:

> Your documents stay on your device.

---

# 27. Key Product Risk

The main implementation risk is high-fidelity offline rendering of Office formats, particularly legacy `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt` and complex modern `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx` files.

Before final library selection, the engineering team should complete a proof-of-concept using real-world documents containing:

- Complex tables
- Non-standard fonts
- Charts
- SmartArt
- Images
- Merged spreadsheet cells
- Formula-heavy workbooks
- Large slide decks
- Embedded media
- Mixed-language and RTL content

The product requirement should be defined as:

> **Reliable, readable, high-fidelity offline viewing of common Office documents.**

It should not promise pixel-perfect Microsoft Office reproduction for every possible file.

# 31. UI States Required Per Screen

Every data-driven screen should define at least these states:

1. **Loading** — data is being prepared.
2. **Loaded** — content available.
3. **Empty** — operation succeeded but no content exists.
4. **Error** — operation failed.
5. **Permission Required** — access is unavailable.
6. **Refresh/Retry** — user can retry safely.

Reader screens additionally require:

1. Initializing reader
2. Loading document
3. Rendering page/sheet/slide
4. Ready
5. Searching
6. Password required
7. Partially supported content
8. Corrupted/unsupported
9. File missing
10. Permission lost

---

# 32. Scenario Validation Matrix

| Scenario | Expected Result | Failure Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh install with permission granted | Scan and show documents | Retry scan |
| Fresh install with permission denied | Limited mode | Show grant access action |
| Open local PDF | PDF Reader opens | Show read error |
| Open DOCX from another app | Word Reader opens | Unsupported/corrupt message |
| Reopen previously read file | Resume position | Fall back to start if invalid |
| Delete file externally | Missing-file warning | Remove stale entry |
| Revoke permission externally | Access warning | Reauthorize |
| Open password PDF | Prompt for password | Retry/cancel |
| Open scanned PDF and search | No searchable text state | Explain OCR not available |
| Open massive workbook | Lazy/controlled rendering | Abort safely if device limit reached |
| Rotate device in reader | Layout adapts | Maintain approximate position |
| App killed in background | State restored next launch | Use last committed position |
| Open two files rapidly | Latest intended navigation wins | Cancel stale load |
| Clear cache | Reader originals unaffected | Rebuild cache as needed |
| Clear Recents | Files remain untouched | Confirm destructive scope only affects history |
| Airplane mode | Full reader operation | No connectivity error shown |
